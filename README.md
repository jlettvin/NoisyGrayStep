# NoisyGrayStep## gray.pyThis creates static images illustrating how perceptionof a sharp boundary is hardly affected by image noise.### Two slightly different gray fields:![alt Clean Gray Step image render failed](https://github.com/jlettvin/NoisyGrayStep/blob/master/CleanGrayStep.png)### Same fields with dominant noise:![alt Noisy Gray Step image render failed](https://github.com/jlettvin/NoisyGrayStep/blob/master/NoisyGrayStep.png)## egray.pyThis creates similar static images illustrating howintroduction of a gradient sharpens perception.## ungray.pyThis uses your first camera to acquire images which are thenprocessed to gray-level boundaries in all three color planes.
